An encoder with transcoding abilities

At my job as an AV-technician we have live events which we use Wowza Media Server to stream live and Video on Demand.
What my thoughts on this is to create an encoder with transcoding abilites which will ease our events for people sitting at home and want to watch the event but has bad internet connections.
Adaptive streaming is one of the things we want to create.
